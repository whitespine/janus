# Janus - The Twin Faced God of Doorways

This Discord bot is meant to provide a method of easy interaction with your FoundryVTT server while you aren't at a machine that would make that otherwise convenient.

For now, only simple stat rolls in DND5E are supported, and even within that frame more advanced mechanics like exhaustion, effects, magic items, etcetera
are not considered. A more robust implementation that would support any system is currently in progress.
